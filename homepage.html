<h2><p align ="center"><u>Abstract</h2></i></p></u>


<p><font size="5">The aim of my investigation was to see how aware people are of the e-waste problem in South Africa, and the different type of ways
 we can better the problem. Hence, finding out how much knowledge and awareness people have on e-waste, it would be easier to navigate through what 
 steps should be taken in order to reduce the e-waste problem in our country.
 After doing some research and creating a questionnaire, i found that 90% of my respondents are aware of
 the e-waste problem. Though 90% of my respondents are aware, only 20% of my respondents has 
 participated in an e-waste recycling initiative, and this could be due to most people not having a deep level understanding of e-waste and just simply 
 aware of it as in "e-waste is not good", another issue may be because people are unaware of e-waste recycling initiatives because they were not 
 educated on it. And so this is why the government needs to do more for the environment when it comes to e-waste. Most of my respondents say that
 they do not think the government has been managing e-waste sufficiently, and that is true because in South Africa, <b><u> only less than 10% of e-waste is recycled.</b></u>
